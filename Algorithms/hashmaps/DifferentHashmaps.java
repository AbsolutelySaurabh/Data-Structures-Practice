//	HashMap:  makes absolutely no guarantees about the iteration order. 
//	It can (and will) even change completely when new elements are added.	
	
	
//	TreeMap:  will iterate according to the "natural ordering" of 
//	the keys according to their compareTo() method (or an externally supplied Comparator). 
//	Additionally, it implements the SortedMap interface, which contains methods that depend on this sort order.
	
	
//	LinkedHashMap:  will iterate in the order in which the entries were put into the map
